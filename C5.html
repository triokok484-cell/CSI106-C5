            <h3>1. The Three Subsystems of a Computer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A computer consists of 3 subsystems: <strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong>, <strong>Main Memory</strong>, and <strong>I/O Subsystem</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Central Processing Unit (CPU) in Detail</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Known as the "brain" of the computer, it has 3 main components:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="highlight"><strong>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</strong></span>: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight"><strong>Control Unit</strong></span>: Directs and coordinates the activities of all other components.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight"><strong>Registers</strong></span>: High-speed temporary storage areas within the CPU.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Program Counter (PC)</strong>: Always points to the address of the <strong>next</strong> instruction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Instruction Register (IR)</strong>: Holds the instruction <strong>currently</strong> being decoded and executed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Main Memory in Detail</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Comprises many memory locations, each with a unique <strong>address</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong>: Read-write memory where data is <span class="highlight"><strong>lost when power is off</strong> (volatile)</span>. Includes SRAM and DRAM.</li>
                <li><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory)</strong>: Read-only memory where data is <span class="highlight"><strong>not lost when power is off</strong> (non-volatile)</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Memory</strong>: Super-fast buffer memory between the CPU and RAM to speed up access.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Hierarchy</strong>: Arranged by decreasing speed: <span class="highlight">Registers ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Main Memory ‚Üí Secondary Storage</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Program Execution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Cycle</strong>: A repeating cycle with 3 core steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li><span class="highlight"><strong>Fetch</strong></span> ‚Äì Load an instruction from memory.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight"><strong>Decode</strong></span> ‚Äì Interpret the instruction.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight"><strong>Execute</strong></span> ‚Äì Carry out the instruction.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>CPU and I/O Synchronization</strong>: 3 main methods, with <strong>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</strong> being the most efficient for large data block transfers as it does not require constant CPU intervention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Computer Architectures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CISC</strong>: Large and complex instruction set.</li>
                <li><strong>RISC</strong>: Small, simple instruction set, which helps in faster execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Pipelining</strong>: Allows for the overlapping execution of multiple instructions to increase <strong>throughput</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Parallel Processing</strong>: Uses multiple processing units to execute work simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>üí° Core Points to Remember</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A computer has 3 parts: <strong>CPU, Memory, I/O.</strong></li>
                    <li>The CPU consists of: <strong>ALU, Control Unit, Registers.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>RAM</strong> is volatile (loses data on power off), <strong>ROM</strong> is not.</li>
                    <li>Speed hierarchy: <strong>Registers > Cache > RAM.</strong></li>
                    <li>The CPU's fundamental cycle is <strong>Fetch ‚Üí Decode ‚Üí Execute.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>DMA</strong> is the most efficient method for large I/O data transfers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pipelining</strong> and <strong>Parallel Processing</strong> are key techniques for performance enhancement.</li>
                </ul>
